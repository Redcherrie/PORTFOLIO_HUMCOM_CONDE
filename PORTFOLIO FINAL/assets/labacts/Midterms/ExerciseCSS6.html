        The foods you eat supply the <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/nutrients/" target="_blank">nutrients</a> your body needs to maintain your brain, muscle, bone, nerves, skin, blood circulation, and immune system, playing a crucial role in supporting all essential bodily functions and ensuring that each system works efficiently to promote overall health and well-being, allowing your body to perform both daily tasks and complex activities with energy and strength while also contributing to long-term vitality and resilience against diseases.
        <br><br>
        "Dietary supplement" is an umbrella term that includes individual <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878" target="_blank">vitamins</a>, such as A, B, C, D, E, and K, as well as essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which are critical in supporting a wide range of bodily functions, from bone health and immune system strength to nerve function and energy production, ensuring the body has the necessary tools to maintain balance, repair tissues, and combat deficiencies, ultimately contributing to optimal physical and mental performance.

        Even though supplements are popular, there is limited evidence they offer significant health benefits or help protect against <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/disease" target="_blank">disease</a>, as many studies suggest that while they can provide nutritional support, they often cannot replace a balanced diet and lifestyle, and their effectiveness in preventing or treating various illnesses remains uncertain, with most health benefits being anecdotal rather than scientifically proven, leading experts to emphasize the importance of whole foods and proper medical care over relying solely on supplements.
