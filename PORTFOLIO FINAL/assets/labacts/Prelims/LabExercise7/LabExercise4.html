        <h2>Proper nutrition helps keep energy levels up and protects against many age-related illnesses and diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. But how do you maintain an eating routine and diet that keeps you and your family healthy and works within your lifestyle and budget?</h2>

        <p>The foods you eat supply the <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/nutrients/"target="_blank">nutrients</a> your body needs to maintain your brain, muscle, bone, nerves, skin, blood circulation, and immune system. Proper nutrition also helps protect you from illness and disease such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis. Eating a balanced diet with a variety of foods ensures that your body receives essential nutrients for optimal function. There are two major classes of nutrients in food: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, protein, and fat, which supply energy (in the form of calories) and serve as the building blocks for muscles and tissues. Carbohydrates provide quick energy, proteins help in tissue repair and growth, and fats support cell function and hormone production. On the other hand, micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, are required in smaller amounts but play a crucial role in metabolism, bone strength, and immune defense. A well-balanced diet that includes both macronutrients and micronutrients is essential for overall health and well-being.</p>

        <p>"Dietary supplement" is an umbrella term that includes individual <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878"target="_blank">vitamins</a>, such as A, B, C, D, E, and K, as well as essential minerals like calcium. These supplements help support various bodily functions, from boosting immunity to promoting bone health. Multivitamins, which contain 10 or more vitamins, minerals, or both, are commonly used to fill nutritional gaps in a personâ€™s diet. Additionally, there are specialized formulas designed for specific needs, such as senior or gender-specific supplements, which provide tailored combinations of vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial compounds. These targeted supplements help address age-related deficiencies, hormonal balance, and overall well-being. While dietary supplements can be beneficial, they should not replace a balanced diet but rather complement it to ensure proper nutrition.</p>

        <p>Even though supplements are popular, there is limited evidence they offer significant health benefits or help protect against <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/disease"target="_blank">disease</a>. For the average healthy adult, eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables provides all the essential vitamins and minerals. However, there are situations when people may need a dietary supplement, such as those diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency that's been confirmed by a blood test, those who have trouble getting certain vitamins from foods, or those who suffer from conditions that require extra vitamins or minerals.</p>

        <p>Healthy eating doesn't have to be hard. With a bit of preparation and planning, it can be easy to create healthy meals for the entire <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/week#google_vignette"target="_blank">week.</a> Meal prep has many benefits: it can help save time and money, support portion control for weight management, and reduce the stress of daily decisions about what to eat. Preparing meals in advance ensures that you have nutritious options readily available, making it easier to stick to a balanced diet. It also minimizes reliance on unhealthy fast food or processed meals. To start, begin small by preparing enough <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dinner"target="_blank">dinners</a> for two to three days of the week, and then gradually increase the number of meals as you get more comfortable. Over time, meal prepping can become a simple and effective habit that promotes healthier eating and a more organized lifestyle.</p>

        <p>Pick a specific <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/day"target="_blank">day</a> of the week to organize your meal prep routine efficiently. Start by planning your menu, whether for the entire week or just a few days, and write out a detailed grocery list to ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Next, go grocery shopping with your list in hand to avoid unnecessary purchases and stick to healthier options. Once you have all your ingredients, begin meal prepping by chopping vegetables, marinating proteins, and cooking meals in advance. Lastly, focus on proper <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/storage"target="_blank">storage</a> to keep your meals fresh and organized. Label all prepped items with a date to track when to use them and rotate stored items so that the oldest foods are kept at the front for easy access. Store highly perishable items like greens, herbs, and chopped fruits at eye level in the fridge to remind yourself to use them before they spoil. Freeze cooked meals in airtight containers to preserve their quality and extend their shelf life, making healthy eating more convenient throughout the week.</p>
